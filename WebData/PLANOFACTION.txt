#MoodyKittens
[SCRIPT LOADER]:
    1) Create script loader for functions
        a) script loader will load all global references and functions at the start of the webpage
        
[UI]:
    1): Create toolbar under "Moody Kittens" header
        a): create basic buttons. "Feed","Pet","Create Demon"
        b): added text field form for name input for said Demon
        c): (if you're feeling special) dock the toolbar to header, if scrolling becomes a necessity
    2): Create kitten display instance
        a): Potentially add row scaling for kitten, default to grid pattern L->R and have a max size given for row
        b): make the damn thing pretty, rows with crappy default gray borders are your worst nightmare :)
        c): status indicator for kitten is contained in row cell. Try placing it below kitten image before anything
        d): if you're feeling fine animate kitten image (single frame) to represent visually cat status
            1): if animation doesn't go as planned, then just have a plain readout. Could be represented as
            Happiness: 0 , Intelligence: 0, Bellyfull: 0
            or 
            Dead, Unwell, Feeling Off, Neutral, Happy, Fuckin Amazin
        e): empty foodbowl image is a placeholder image for styling, do something to it for extra brownie points
        f): add status indicator for different times of day, this could potentially be represented as background color
            changing but that may be too much work to try and accomedate color change with the entire page
    3): BOOM! UI! DONEZO!
[Functionality]:
    1): Create automatic font weight changer: DONE!
    
    2): Create demon function
        a): primarily consists of initializing defautl/basic variables and characteristics of demon cat
        b): after initialization object instance of cat should be able to act indepdently of other instances
        c): store reference and any related data to local storage JSON FILE NEEDED <---- 
        MSDN DOC(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
        StackOverflow Sample(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage)
        d): kittens status should be affected by isolated to itself, and be affected by day cylce and time which is globally ran
            Example flow:
            WEBPAGE->
                Day Cycle Timer->
                Kitten->
                Kitten->
                Kitten->
                Kitten->
        e): dispose of the body
            a): delete references to cats and contained values. remove from local storage. Alive/Dead indication should be declared and updated in real time
        f): time should affect how long cats should go before eating again. Cats feeding times are independent of one another.
            it's important to make a time scale for this. Time scale cannot be adjusted to a weird value with a small number of kittens
            example:
            2 Kittens with a time scale of 5x (5 times of the speed time)
            (this is where the difficulty spike comes from, the more cats you have but wish to speed up time it becomes quickly CHAOS!!)

            Fuck bitches get money!
            done!
